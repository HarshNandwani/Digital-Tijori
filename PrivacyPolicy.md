# Digital Tijori Privacy Policy

This privacy policy governs your use of the Digital Tijori app that was created by Harsh Nandwani. This is an open source android app which helps you store your bank accounts, cards and credentials. Locally and securely. The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/HarshNandwani/Digital-Tijori)

Digital Tijori doesn't collect any **Personal Identifiable Information** such as name, address, email, telephone, etc.
Digital Tijori doesn't automatically collect any information that is not explicitly entered by the user.

Digital Tijori does however collect information like bank account details, payment card details and credentials, only when the user enters them in the forms present in the app. All this data is stored in the user's phone/device locally and is never shared outside by Digital Tijori. Infact, the app doesn't even connect to the Internet so there's no way to share all the information.
All the data that is created by the user can be deleted by clearing the app data or by uninstalling the app.

If have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send an email on developer.harsh.nandwani@gmail.com
